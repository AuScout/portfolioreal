    <h1>---Random Things About Me---</h1>

      <h2>Bio:</h2>
      <p>
    Hello. My name is <strong>Nicole</strong> and I am currently a rising senior in an art academy at <a href="http://www.francislewishs.org/">Francis Lewis High School</a> . I joined Girls Who Code because I am interested in making games in the future. My brother  is also interested in the computer science field. During my free time, I like to do a variety of things, including drawing, watching anime, or playing video games.
    </p>

    <h2>Likes:</h2>

    It would be impossible to list everything here but as I mentioned before, I really like drawing. Oh how I wish I had more time to draw. Here is an example of what I do:</br>

My brother did the background, heh. He can use photoshop better than me at the moment so...</br>

Another example of what I drew... Yeah, I really need to draw more ( ^-^)/

      <h2>Dislikes:</h2>
    Just recently, I have been disliking math in general. It is an important concept but the class is so <strong>harsh</strong>.<h3></br>
